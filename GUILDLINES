Horizontal Scaling
There should be no "tech tiers" expect for erly machinary and standart one. bigger is bigger.
so there shuldnt be two devices that do the same just with better/worse performance

No super high tech crazy stuff
so the addon will keep the retro style theme

the addon should be minimalistic about adding new materials like blocks and items for components as the original mod has lots oh those.
big modpacks have too many small items that are used only once. multiblocks helps reusability of ieads without killing the complexity

COMPLEXITY == FUN
and not all the players like fun. some of them like simple stuff. so not all machines need to be super duper complicated (for the plebs)

addons are about expanding not about recreating. so the general gameplay should be preserved. (aka, theme and style).
